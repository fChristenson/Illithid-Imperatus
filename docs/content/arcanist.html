<blockquote>
    Mind flayers considered arcane magic an abomination. They viewed it as an inferior and corrupt form of psionic power
    that should disappear from the universe once the illithids regained control of it. It was speculated that this
    hatred was related to the role of magic in the gith rebellion.

    Arcane magic was especially sought out by renegade illithids looking for ways to shield themselves from the elder
    brain's influence. Although most mind flayer arcanists were wizards, a few were also born with the gift of
    sorcery. Because a mind flayer sorcerer was naturally more intelligent than other mind flayers, it was better able
    to resist psionics. For the most part, an illithid with the gift of sorcery would use defensive spells such as
    greater invisibility and resist energy, as well as spells to further hinder enemies, such as ray of exhaustion and
    touch of idiocy.
