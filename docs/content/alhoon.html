<blockquote>
    "Alhoons were magic-using outcasts from mind flayer societies who had defied the ruling elder brains to achieve a
    limited form of lichdom. Only the most powerful mind flayer mages could achieve true lichdom and were known as
    illithiliches; however, many in the Realms did not make this distinction."
